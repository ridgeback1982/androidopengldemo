# androidopengldemo
this repo is for who want to learn and use OpenGL on Android platform for his work and life.

For **CameraCube**, it is based on OpenGL ES 1.0, which is not compatible with OpenGL ES 2.0. GLSL is not supported here. I use GLSurfaceView for rendering, instead of SurfaceView, for simplicity.
